MPEG to MATLAB Movie Converter
------------------------------

MPEG is an ISO standard movie encoding format.  The MPEG converter
for MATLAB takes an MPEG file and converts it into a MATLAB movie
matrix.

The MPEG converter is a MATLAB mex file which can be built using the
included Makefile by calling make at the unix prompt.  An ANSI C
compiler is required.  Makefile can be modified if necessary to specify
an ANSI compiler.  The resulting mex file can be invoked by calling
"mpgread" from the MATLAB command line.
On the PC, run the makedll m-file from within MATLAB to build the mex-file.
Both Makefile and makedll.m can be found in the src subdirectory along
with the source code.

For documentation on the use of mpgread, read the file "mpgread.doc".

Portions of the MPEG converter are Copyrighted (c) 1993 by The
Regents of the University of California.

A MATLAB movie to MPEG converter is also available.
