function [VM,iI,iJ] = parsePlane(V,MS,OL,SW)
%This function takes a plane or set of planes and parses it into pieces
%according to the following:
% 1) "MS" is the maximum size allowed for an individual parse dimension.
% 2) "OL" is the percentage overlap of the parses.
% 3) "SW" is a switch allowing for choice of rectangular or square parses.
%Thus, the program will parse the plane into the minimum number of pieces
%which are smaller than the maximum allowed size with a desired amount of
%overlap. In addition, the user can force the pieces to be square. The
%result is a set of matrices which are all of the same size and will have
%dimensions less than "MS", but also minimizes the number of pieces within
%the constraint of "MS." Since all parses will be the same size, it is
%likely that the total size of the combined matrix will be slightly larger 
%than the input matrix. The overflow will be located on the ends of the
%matrix (e.g. end-2:end).
%
%INPUTS
% V - plane or set of planes. Parsing will occur over the first two
%  dimensions of V and multiple planes can be parsed simultaneously by
%  stacking planes in the third dimension.
% MS - the maximum allowed parse length. NOTE: typical parses will be
%  smaller than "MS."
% OL - The percentage overlap between parses as fraction of parse length.
% SW - Allows user to choose square or rectangular parses. Valid inputs are
%  'square' or 'rect'.
%
%OUTPUTS
% VM - a cell array containing the parsed matrices.
% iI - the indices along the first dimension for the parses. Allows for
%  easy reconstruction of the original matrix. The starting index for each
%  parse is located in the first row of "iI". The ending indices are in the
%  second row.
% iJ - the indices along the second dimension for the parses.
