The PIVMat Toolbox for Matlab contains a set of command-line functions to
import, post-process and analyse 2- and 3-components vector fields from
various file formats, including DaVis files from LaVision (PIV and
Synthetic Schlieren applications).

It enables to handle and perform complex operations over large amount of
vector fields, and to produce high-quality 2D and 3D outputs based on
standard Matlab visualization tools.

The PIVMat Toolbox in itself does not perform any PIV computations.

Compatibility

The PIVMat Toolbox works with MATLAB 8 or higher, on every operating system
(Windows, Unix, Mac).

Files from DaVis 6 and 7 (formats VEC, VC7, IMG, IMX, IM7, SET and EXP),
DPIVSoft (format MAT), MatPIV (format MAT) and Optical Flow files (formats
UW0 and CM0) are supported.

Note that the import of DaVis files requires to install first the READIMX
package provided by LaVision: see the installation procedure below.

Some functions require the Image Processing Toolbox.

Installation procedure

1. Download the PIVMat Toolbox and extract the ZIP file in a folder, for
example /My documents/Matlab/toolbox/pivmat (make sure the subdirectories
html, sample and private are correctly unzipped as well). Do NOT install in
the Matlab application folder (typically /Program Files/Matlab/...). If you
upgrade from an older version, first empty the previous directory.

2. If you wish to import DaVis files, download also the ReadIMX package
from the 'Download' area of the LaVision web site www.lavision.de (menu
Software, submenu DaVis Add-Ons), and extract the ZIP file in another
folder, for example /My documents/Matlab/toolbox/readimx. Note that you
need to sign up first and login to access to the LaVision download area.

3. From the menu 'File > Set Path', click on 'Add Folder' (NOT 'Add with
Subfolders') and select the directories pivmat and readimx. Click on 'Save'
and 'Close'.

4. Restart MATLAB. To get started, type docpivmat.
